## Introduction

This project is a web page created from a design provided as part of an assignment from **The Odin Project**. The design specification was given in the form of two images: 

1. An image of the complete website layout.
2. A detailed design guide with information about the fonts, colors, and some layout instructions.

The goal was to recreate the entire web page as closely as possible to the provided design using only **HTML** and **CSS**. This project challenged me to apply my knowledge of web development, including responsive design, CSS layouts, and styling techniques.

Throughout this process, I encountered several design and layout challenges that required problem-solving and creativity to replicate the given design accurately.

### Key Aspects of the Project:

- **Design Implementation**: Recreating the design exactly as it appeared in the reference images.
- **Responsive Layout**: Ensuring the webpage is responsive and works well on various screen sizes.
- **Font & Color Matching**: Accurately applying the specified fonts and color schemes as outlined in the design guide.
- **Hover Effects**: Adding hover animations to elements like buttons and links for an interactive user experience.

While this project may seem simple at first glance, it required careful attention to detail and a deep understanding of CSS positioning, flexbox, and responsive design techniques.

### Skills Developed

- Applying designs to code with precision.
- Building layouts using **CSS Flexbox**.
- Implementing responsive designs with media queries.
- Working with custom fonts and color schemes to match design specs.
- Enhancing interactivity through **CSS hover effects** and transitions.
